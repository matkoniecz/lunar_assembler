    Generation of vector maps from OpenStreetMap data (SVG files). Map style has support for areas such as buildings, water, parks, forests, road areas (where mapped) and linear features such as roads, railways, waterways, taxiway, runways.
    <ul>
    <li>Move map to a small area interesting for you (a single park will work, generating map of Poland will fail).</li>
    <li>Press "rectangle" button, select interesting area for you.</li>
    <li>Wait - waiting several seconds is normal, currently no progress info is displayed.</li>
    <li>Generated map should appear below map used for selecting, download should be also automatically triggered. There is also download button available below generated map image.</li>
    <li>Use this for something!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you used this for something - you are welcomed to share it <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz/lunar_assembler/issues/new">publicly</a> or by sending my an <a href="mailto:matkoniecz@tutanota.com">email</a>.</p>

    <p>Have fun with using OpenStreetMap data for interesting and/or useful purposes! Just remember that you must mention source of data in way visible to whoever will be using it. See <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">this page</a> for details, including cases where it is legally allowed to avoid giving a clear credit (but I encourage to do this in all cases).</p>

    <p>As mentioned this is experimental tool, many obvious issues are known - but if something was missed or you want to help see <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz/lunar_assembler/issues">list of known issues and TODOs</a></p>

  
 
    <p>If you want to help mapping and you are unsure how to start - you can try <a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete#download">StreetComplete</a> (an Android app) allowing contributions, with sole requirements being (1) ability to read (2) ability to see things (3) ability to create an OpenStreetMap acount.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to map something (map missing objects, fix mistake) and you are unsure how to start - visit <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a>, zoom in to interesting area and press "edit" button and follow instructions. You can contact OpenStreetMap community using one of global or local channels listed at <a href="https://community.osm.be/">community.osm.be</a>.</p>
