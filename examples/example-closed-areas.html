This map style is supposed to work well with tiny areas, such as crossing. area:highway tagging is supposed to be used, otherwise it will not work.</p>

            <p>Map generator marking private areas without a public access. You can move to any place in the world and generate map from OSM data.</p>

            <p>Detects areas blocked by fences, walls, buildings - without public road/footway leading there.</p>
                
            <p>Areas inaccessible to pedestrians are marked as a strong yellow.</p>

            <p>Requires mapped barriers, roads/footways to be taken into account must be within range of the rectangle.</p>
