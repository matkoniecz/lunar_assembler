        <p id="instruction_hidden_after_first_generation">Press the rectangle button, select a rectangle on a map and wait. Note that this tool will work well with small areas. Entire cities may work, but will require long processing. Processing entire countries will fail.</p>

        <p>Generation of vector maps from OpenStreetMap data. Supports <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:area%3Ahighway">area:highway</a> tagging, works well for tiny areas (single crossing), neighbourhood maps - or of a single forest/airport/etc. Will work for entire town, villages - maybe even entire cities.</p>

        <p>See also <a href=".">other map styles</a>, allowing generation of other maps from the same OpenStreetMap data.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Move map to a small area interesting for you (a single crossing will work, generating a map of Poland will fail).</li>
                <li>Press the "rectangle" button, choose an area of interest.</li>
                <li>Wait - waiting several seconds is normal, currently no real progress info is displayed during download. Not even progress bar animation is shown when map is generated in your browser, it may take a bit.</li>
                <li>The generated map should appear below the map used for selecting. There is also a download button available below the generated map image.</li>
                <li>Use this map for something!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Map style has support for areas such as buildings, water, parks, forests, road areas and linear features such as roads, railways, waterways, taxiway, runways. Produced SVG files can be downloaded.</p>

        <h2>Even more info</h2>
        <p>Have fun with using OpenStreetMap data for interesting and/or useful purposes! Just remember that you must mention source of data in a way visible to whoever will be using it. See <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">this page</a> for details, including cases where it is legally allowed to avoid giving a clear credit (but I encourage to do this in all cases).</p>
