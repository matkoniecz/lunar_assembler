        <p>Generation of vector maps from OpenStreetMap data, for use in laser cutters for producing tactile maps.</p>
        
        <p id="instruction_hidden_after_first_generation">Press the rectangle button, select a rectangle on a map and wait. Note that this tool will work well with small areas, such as a neighbourhood.</p>

        <p>See also <a href=".">other map styles</a>, allowing generation of other maps from the same OpenStreetMap data.</p>

        <p>(there is more text below map, you can also see an <a href="lunar_assembler_in_action.gif">animation</a> showing how this tool is supposed to work)</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Move map to a small area interesting for you (a single crossing will work, generating a map of Poland will fail).</li>
                    <li>Press the "rectangle" button, select interesting area for you.</li>
                    <li>Wait - waiting several seconds is normal, currently no real progress info is displayed during download. Not even progress bar animation is shown when map is generated in your browser, it may take a bit.</li>
                    <li>Generated map should appear below the map used for selecting. There is also download button available below generated map image.</li>
                    <li>Use this map for something!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
    
            <p>Map style is generating SVG design files for use in a laser cutter. As orientation maps for blind people of a very small area, such as a single road crossing.</p>
            <p>laser parameters that I used are given, but this is a solely example! You will need to test it on laser cutter you use which parameters are optimal. Yes, it is time consuming</p>
            <p>TODO: finish describing parameters at closeup, clone relevant ones</p>
