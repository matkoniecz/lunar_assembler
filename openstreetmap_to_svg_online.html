    Generation of SVG files from OpenStreetMap data. Experimental proof of concept. Map style is very limited (support for areas such as buildings, water, parks, forests, area:highway).
    <ul>
    <li>Move map to a small area interesting for you (single park will work, generating map of Poland will fail).</li>
    <li>Press "rectangle" button, select interesting area for you.</li>
    <li>Wait - waiting several seconds is normal, currently no progress info is displayed.</li>
    <li>Generated map should appear below map used for selecting, download should be also automatically triggered. There is also download button available below generated map image.</li>
    <li>Use this for something!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you used this for something - you are welcomed to share it <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz/lunar_assembler/issues/new">publicly</a> or by sending my an <a href="mailto:matkoniecz@tutanota.com">email</a>.</p>

    <p>(there is more text below map)
    
    <div id="map" style="width: 600px; height: 400px"></div><!-- 
        note: right now id="map" is mandatory - without it everything will break.
        Feel free to make PR if that is causing problems for you

    <p>Have fun with using OpenStreetMap data for interesting and/or useful purposes! Just remember that you must mention source of data in way visible to whoever will be using it. See <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">this page</a> for details, including cases where it is legally allowed to avoid giving a clear credit (but I encourage to do this in all cases).</p>

    <p>As mentioned this is experimental tool, many obvious issues are known - but if something was missed or you want to help see <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz/lunar_assembler/issues">list of known issues and TODOs</a></p>
